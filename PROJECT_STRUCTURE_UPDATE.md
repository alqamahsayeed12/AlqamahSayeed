# GitHub Pages Deployment: URL Path Fix

I've updated the project configuration to fix the blank page issue. The problem was that the site was being deployed to a different URL structure than we anticipated.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Updated Base URL** - Changed the Vite configuration to use the proper repository path: `/alqamah-sayeed.github.io/`

2. **Updated Homepage in package.json** - Changed to match your actual GitHub username structure: `https://alqamahsayeed12.github.io/alqamah-sayeed.github.io`

3. **Switched to HashRouter** - Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter which works better with GitHub Pages

## Download Updated Files:

1. Download the updated `clean-deploy.tar.gz` file from Replit
2. Extract and redeploy following the same steps as before

## Why This Fixes The Issue:

GitHub Pages projects hosted at username.github.io/repository-name (instead of username.github.io) require specific configuration:

1. The `base` path in vite.config.js needs to match the repository name
2. The router should use hash-based routing to avoid 404 errors on page refreshes
3. The homepage in package.json should have the full URL including username and repository

## Deployment Steps:

1. Extract the updated archive:
   ```
   tar -xzf clean-deploy.tar.gz
   cd clean-deploy
   ```

2. Initialize Git and push:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update with proper URL path configuration"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/alqamahsayeed12/alqamah-sayeed.github.io.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main --force
   ```

3. Install dependencies and deploy:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run deploy
   ```

Once deployed, your site should be visible (not blank) at:
https://alqamahsayeed12.github.io/alqamah-sayeed.github.io/

## Alternative Approach:

If you want a cleaner URL structure, you could:

1. Create a repository named exactly `alqamahsayeed12.github.io` (your username + .github.io)
2. Deploy to that repository instead
3. Your site would then be available at: https://alqamahsayeed12.github.io/

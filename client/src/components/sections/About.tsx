                As the Thematic Lead for NASA SERVIR's global Air Quality and Health thematic area, I lead the design and development of next-generation satellite-based monitoring tools and predictive deep learning frameworks that are reshaping air pollution forecasting. By collaborating with regional hubs across Southeast Asia, the Hindu Kush Himalaya, and Eastern and Southern Africa, I help deliver actionable environmental intelligence to support local decision-making and climate resilience.

                I hold a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Houston, where my research focused on integrating deep learning with numerical models to improve weather and air quality forecasting. Before that, I completed an M.Tech in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where my master's thesis explored how climate change could impact India's wind energy potential. I began my academic journey with a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Ideal Institute of Technology, Ghaziabad, India.

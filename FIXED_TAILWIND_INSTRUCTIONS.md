# Fixed Tailwind CSS Issue: Deployment Instructions

I've fixed the Tailwind CSS error you were encountering with the `border-border` utility class. The error occurred because this utility class wasn't properly defined in your Tailwind configuration.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Updated `index.css`** - Changed `@apply border-border;` to `@apply border-[hsl(var(--border))];` which directly uses the CSS variable
2. **Created a JavaScript version of Tailwind config** - Added a `tailwind.config.js` file instead of using TypeScript
3. **Added proper content paths** - Updated the content paths in Tailwind config to match the GitHub Pages structure
4. **Added postcss.config.js** - Ensured all necessary configuration files are present

## Download Instructions:

1. In the Replit file explorer, locate the file `github-deploy.tar.gz` (I just recreated it with the fixes)
2. Right-click on it and select "Download" to save it to your computer

## Deployment Steps:

1. Extract the downloaded archive
   ```bash
   tar -xzf github-deploy.tar.gz
   cd github-deploy
   ```

2. Initialize Git repository
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio website with Tailwind fixes"
   ```

3. Create GitHub repository named exactly `alqamah-sayeed.github.io`
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Create a public repository with this exact name

4. Connect your local repository to GitHub
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Alqamah-Sayeed/alqamah-sayeed.github.io.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. Install dependencies and deploy
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Important Note:

The changes I made specifically fix the `border-border` Tailwind CSS build error by:
1. Changing how border colors are applied in the base CSS
2. Using a proper JavaScript Tailwind configuration file that's compatible with the build process

These changes maintain all the functionality and design of your site while resolving the build error.

## Verifying Your Deployment:

After running `npm run deploy`, your site should be available at:
https://alqamah-sayeed.github.io

# Fixed Font Sans Issue: Final Deployment Instructions

I've fixed the `font-sans` utility class error that was occurring during your build. This was the second issue after fixing the ESM module format issue.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Added Font Family Definition in Tailwind Config** - I added an explicit `fontFamily` configuration in the Tailwind config file to define the `sans` font family
   
2. **Updated index.css to use native CSS** - Instead of using `@apply font-sans`, I used standard CSS `font-family` properties to avoid any build issues

## Download Instructions:

1. In the Replit file explorer, locate the file `github-deploy.tar.gz` (I've recreated it with all fixes)
2. Right-click on it and select "Download" to save it to your computer

## Deployment Steps:

1. Extract the downloaded archive
   ```bash
   tar -xzf github-deploy.tar.gz
   cd github-deploy
   ```

2. Initialize Git repository
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio website with all build fixes"
   ```

3. Create GitHub repository named exactly `alqamah-sayeed.github.io`
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Create a public repository with this exact name

4. Connect your local repository to GitHub
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Alqamah-Sayeed/alqamah-sayeed.github.io.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. Install dependencies and deploy
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Summary of All Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed `border-border` issue**: Changed to use `border-[hsl(var(--border))]` directly
2. **Fixed module format issue**: Updated config files to use ES Module syntax for compatibility with package.json `"type": "module"`
3. **Fixed `font-sans` issue**: Added proper font family configuration in Tailwind and used native CSS for font styling

## If You Still Encounter Issues:

If you continue to encounter issues with the Tailwind build process, there's an alternative approach you can try:

1. Edit `package.json` and remove the line `"type": "module"`
2. Then use the CommonJS format for config files (rename them with .cjs extension or rewrite them)

## Verifying Your Deployment:

After running `npm run deploy`, your site should be available at:

# Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

## Username & Repository Information

- GitHub Username: `alqamahsayeed12`
- Repository Name: `alqamahsayeed.github.io`

## Option 1: Using the Provided Deployment Package (Recommended)

In this Replit project, I've already prepared deployment packages for GitHub Pages, including:

- `alqamahsayeed-portfolio-deploy.zip`
- `github-pages-static.tar.gz`

### Steps:

1. Download one of these files to your computer
2. Extract the contents
3. Follow the README instructions inside to deploy to GitHub Pages

## Option 2: Generate a Fresh Deployment Package

If you'd like to generate a fresh deployment package with the latest changes:

1. Run the script in this Replit:
   ```
   node create-github-package.js
   ```

2. This will create `github-pages-package.zip` which you can download
3. Extract it on your computer
4. Follow the README instructions inside

## Option 3: Direct Deployment from Replit (Advanced)

If you have your GitHub SSH keys set up and linked to Replit:

1. Run:
   ```
   node deploy-to-github.js
   ```

2. This will build and deploy directly to your GitHub repository
3. You might need to enter your GitHub credentials during the process

## GitHub Pages Configuration

After deploying, make sure to:

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to Pages in the sidebar
3. Ensure the branch is set to `main` (or `gh-pages` if you used that method)
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build and publish your site

Your portfolio will be available at: https://alqamahsayeed.github.io

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the GitHub repository exists with the exact name `alqamahsayeed.github.io`
2. Ensure you're logged in with username `alqamahsayeed12`
3. Verify your GitHub credentials are working correctly
4. For SSH issues, ensure your SSH keys are properly set up

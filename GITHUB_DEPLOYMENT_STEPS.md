# GitHub Pages Deployment Steps

## Option 1: Using the Pre-Built Package (Recommended)

The easiest approach is to use the pre-built deployment package that's already configured for your GitHub account.

### Steps:

1. Download `alqamahsayeed-portfolio-deploy.zip` from this Replit project
2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer
3. Create a new GitHub repository:
   - Username: `alqamahsayeed12`
   - Repository name: `alqamahsayeed.github.io`
   - Make it public
   - Do not initialize with any files

4. In the extracted folder, open a terminal/command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Once the dependencies are installed, deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   node deploy-gh-pages.js
   ```

6. This will push the files to your GitHub repository
7. Go to your GitHub repository settings → Pages and ensure source is set to the `main` branch
8. After a few minutes, your site will be live at https://alqamahsayeed.github.io

## Option 2: Using the Simplified Static Version

If you prefer a simpler approach with just HTML/CSS/JS:

1. Download `github-pages-static.tar.gz` from this Replit project
2. Extract the contents to a folder on your computer
3. Create the GitHub repository as described in Option 1
4. Upload all the extracted files to your repository (via GitHub web interface or git commands)
5. Go to your GitHub repository settings → Pages and ensure source is set to the `main` branch

## Option 3: Super Simplified Version

For the most minimal deployment:

1. Download `github-pages-super-simple.tar.gz` from this Replit
2. Extract it
3. Create the GitHub repository as described in Option 1
4. Upload all files to your repository
5. Configure GitHub Pages as described above

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you're using the exact GitHub username `alqamahsayeed12`
2. Ensure the repository name is exactly `alqamahsayeed.github.io`
3. Check if the repository is public
4. If using SSH for GitHub authentication, ensure your SSH keys are properly set up
5. If using HTTPS, you'll need to provide your GitHub credentials
